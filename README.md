# Experiments with AdaFruit Express board

This repository wraps scripts of things I am trying out with the Express Board. With it I plan to work on growing plants at home, after some inspiration from the Open Agriculture Initiative. With all these movements to produce things by yourself I think agriculture one that makes sense. Yes, making (good) beer at your house is way harder than growing kale, so I am happy to pay someone to pour me a pint.

Indoor farming has the potential to help societies with food problems. The cost still far from feasible at scale, as Aluminium was once very expensive until people put together the Bayer process, in 1889, and Alum was known since before Herodotus, dating back to the 5th century BCE. It's never to late to create new ways of achieving the same results, hopefully with a better price, without transportation costs, and toxic substances. One can work on big problems.

Hopefully most of the code shared here will be documented and helpful to other people. Hugs.
